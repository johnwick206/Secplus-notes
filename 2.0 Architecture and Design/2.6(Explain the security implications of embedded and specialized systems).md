#### Logic Controllers for Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are normally based on firmware running on a programmable logic controller (PLC). These PLCs are built from different hardware and OS components than some desktop PCs.Â 

 - System on Chip(SOC)
   - System on chip (SoC) is a design where all these processors, controllers, and devices are provided on a single processor die (or chip). 
   - Raspberry Pi, Arduino

 - Field Programmable Gate Array(FGPA)
   - A processor that can be programmed to perform a specific function by a customer rather than at the time of manufacture.
   - The structure of the controller is not fully set at the time of manufacture. The end customer can configure the programming logic of the device to run a specific application.

 - Real-time Operating System(RTOS)
   - A type of OS that prioritizes deterministic execution of operations to ensure consistent response for time-critical tasks.
   - An RTOS should be designed to have as small an attack surface as possible. An RTOS is still susceptible to CVEs and exploits, however.
