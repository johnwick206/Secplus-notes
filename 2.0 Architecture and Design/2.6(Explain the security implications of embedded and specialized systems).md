### Logic Controllers for Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are normally based on firmware running on a programmable logic controller (PLC). These PLCs are built from different hardware and OS components than some desktop PCs.Â 

 - System on Chip(SOC)
   - System on chip (SoC) is a design where all these processors, controllers, and devices are provided on a single processor die (or chip). 
   - Raspberry Pi, Arduino

 - Field Programmable Gate Array(FGPA)
   - A processor that can be programmed to perform a specific function by a customer rather than at the time of manufacture.
   - The structure of the controller is not fully set at the time of manufacture. The end customer can configure the programming logic of the device to run a specific application.

 - Real-time Operating System(RTOS)
   - A type of OS that prioritizes deterministic execution of operations to ensure consistent response for time-critical tasks.
   - An RTOS should be designed to have as small an attack surface as possible. An RTOS is still susceptible to CVEs and exploits, however.

### Communication Considerations

 - Operational Technology (OT) Networks
   - A cabled network for industrial applications is referred to as an operational technology (OT) network.
   - These typically use either serial data protocols or industrial Ethernet. 
   - Industrial Ethernet is optimized for real-time, deterministic transfers. Such networks might use vendor-developed data link and networking protocols, as well as specialist application protocols.

 - Cellular Networks
   - A cellular network enables long-distance communication over the same system that supports mobile and smartphones. This is also called baseband radio(The chip and firmware in a smartphone that acts as a cellular modem), after the baseband processor that performs the function of a cellular modem.
   - Narrowband-IOT(NB-IOT): this refers to a low-power version of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) or 4G cellular standard. This means that data rates are limited (20-100 kbps), but most sensors need to send small packets with low latency, rather than making large data transfers. Narrowband also has greater penetrating power, making it more suitable for use in inaccessible locations, such as tunnels or deep within buildings
   - LTE Machine Type Communication (LTE-M): this is another low-power system, but supports higher bandwidth (up to about 1 Mbps).

 - both NB-IoT and LTE-M are designed to be compatible with 5G networks.
 - Any LTE-based cellular radio uses a subscriber identity module (SIM) card as an identifier.

### Z-Wave and Zigbee
 - Z-Wave and Zigbee are wireless communications protocols used primarily for home automation.
 - Both create a mesh network topology, using low-energy radio waves to communicate from one appliance to another.
 - Z-Wave: 
   - devices can be configured to work as repeaters to extend the network but there is a limit of four "hops" between a controller device and an endpoint. 
   - Z-Wave uses ~900 Mhz frequencies.
 - Zigbee:
   - Zigbee uses the 2.4 GHz frequency band. 
   - This higher frequency allows more data bandwidth at the expense of range compared to Z-Wave and the greater risk of interference from other 2.4 GHz radio communications. 
   - Zigbee supports more overall devices within a single network and there is no hop limit for communication between devices.
