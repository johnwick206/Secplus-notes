Notes: 

 - Configuration Management: The process through which an organization's information systems components are kept in a controlled state that meets the organization's requirements, including those for security and compliance.
 - Configuration management ensures that each component of ICT infrastructure is in a trusted state that has not diverged from its documented properties. Change control and change management reduce the risk that changes to these components could cause service disruption. 
 - Service assets are things, processes, or people that contribute to the delivery of an IT service.
 - A Configuration Item (CI) is an asset that requires specific management procedures for it to be used to deliver the service. 
 - A baseline configuration is the template of settings that a device, VM instance, or other CI was configured to, and that it should continue to match.\A configuration management system (CMS) is the tools and databases that collect, store, manage, update, and present information about CIs and their relationships.
 - Diagrams are the best way to capture the complex relationships between network elements.
