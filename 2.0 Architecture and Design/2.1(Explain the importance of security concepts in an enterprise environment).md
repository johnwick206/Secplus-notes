Notes: 

 - Configuration Management: The process through which an organization's information systems components are kept in a controlled state that meets the organization's requirements, including those for security and compliance.
 - Configuration management ensures that each component of ICT infrastructure is in a trusted state that has not diverged from its documented properties. Change control and change management reduce the risk that changes to these components could cause service disruption. 
 - Service assets are things, processes, or people that contribute to the delivery of an IT service.
 - A Configuration Item (CI) is an asset that requires specific management procedures for it to be used to deliver the service. 
 - A baseline configuration is the template of settings that a device, VM instance, or other CI was configured to, and that it should continue to match.\A configuration management system (CMS) is the tools and databases that collect, store, manage, update, and present information about CIs and their relationships.
 - Diagrams are the best way to capture the complex relationships between network elements.

# Privacy and Data Protection Controls

1.To what data state does a trusted execution environment apply data protection?

 > Data in processing/data in use.

2.You take an incident report from a user trying to access a REPORT.docx file on a SharePoint site. The file has been replaced by a REPORT.docx.QUARANTINE.txt file containing a policy violation notice. What is the most likely cause?

 > This is typical of a data loss prevention (DLP) policy replacing a file involved in a policy violation with a tombstone file.

3.You are preparing a solution overview on privacy enhancing technologies based on CompTIA Security+ syllabus objectives. You have completed notes under the following headings—which other report section do you need?

Data minimization, Anonymization, Pseudo-anonymization, Data masking, Aggregation/Banding

 > Tokenization—replacing data with a randomly-generated token from a separate token server or vault. This allows reconstruction of the original data if combined with the token vault.
