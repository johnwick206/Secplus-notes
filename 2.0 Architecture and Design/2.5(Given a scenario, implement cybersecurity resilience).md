Notes: 
 - Assuming a backup is performed every working day, an incremental backup only includes files changed during that day, while a differential backup includes all files changed since the last full backup. 
 - Incremental backups save backup time but can be more time-consuming when the system must be restored. The system must be restored from the last full backup set and then from each incremental backup that has subsequently occurred.
 - A differential backup system only involves two tape sets when restoration is required.Â 


# Redundancy Strategies

1.How does MTD relate to availability?
 > The maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) metric expresses the availability requirement for a particular business function.

2.How does elasticity differ from scalability?
 > A scalable system is one that responds to increased workloads by adding resources without exponentially increasing costs. An elastic system is able to assign or unassign resources as needed to match either an increased workload or a decreased workload.

3.Which two components are required to ensure power redundancy for a blackout period extending over 24 hours?
 > An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is required to provide failover for the initial blackout event, before switching over to a standby generator to supply power over a longer period.

4.How does RAID support fault tolerance?
 > Aside from RAID 0, RAID provides redundancy between a group of disks, so that if one disk were to fail, that data may be recoverable from the other disks in the array.

# Backup Strategies

1.What type of scheduled Windows backup job does not clear the archive attribute?
 > A differential backup. This type of backup selects all new and modified data since the previous full backup. You could also mention copy backups, though these are usually ad hoc rather than scheduled.

2.How does VSS assist a backup solution?
 > The volume shadow copy service(VSS) creates snapshots for the backup software to use, avoiding problems with file locks and uncompleted database transactions.

3.True or false? Backup media can be onsite, but offline.
 > True. As a security precaution, backup media can be taken offline at the completion of a job to mitigate the risk of malware corrupting the backup.

4.You are advising a company about backup requirements for a few dozen application servers hosting tens of terabytes of data. The company requires online availability of short-term backups, plus offsite security media and long-term archive storage. The company cannot use a cloud solution. What type of on-premises storage solution is best suited to the requirement?
 > The offsite and archive requirements are best met by a tape solution, but the online requirement may need a RAID array, depending on speed. The requirement is probably not large enough to demand a storage area network (SAN), but could be provisioned as part of one.

5.What is the risk of not following a tested order of restoration when recovering a site from a major incident?
 > There may be unmet dependencies between systems that are started in the wrong order. This could lead to boot failures and possibly data corruption.

# Cybersecurity Resiliency Strategies

 > You are preparing a white paper on configuration management essentials for your customers. You have the following headings already: Diagrams, Standard naming conventions, Internet protocol (IP) schema. If you are basing your paper on the ComptTIA Security+ objectives, which other topic should you cover?
 > The configuration baseline is an essential concept as it allows unauthorized change to be detected more easily and planned change to be managed more easily.

2.What are the risks of not having a documented IP schema?
 > Configuration errors are more likely, especially where complex access control lists (ACLs) and security monitoring sensor deployment is required.

3.In organizational policies, what two concepts govern change?
 > A change control process governs the way changes are requested and approved. A change management process governs the way that planned change is implemented and the way unplanned change is handled.

4.Which terms are used to discuss levels of site resiliency?
 > Hot, warm, and cold sites, referring to the speed with which a site can failover.

5.You are preparing some briefing notes on diversity strategies for cybersecurity resilience for the executive team. You have prepared sections on Technologies, Crypto, and Controls so far. What other topic do you need to cover?
 > Vendor diversity.

6.How could a deception-based cybersecurity resilience strategy return fake telemetry to a threat actor?
 > Fake telemetry means that when a threat actor runs port or host discovery scans, a spoof response is returned. This could lead the threat actor to waste time probing the port or host IP address trying to develop an attack vector that does not actually exist.
