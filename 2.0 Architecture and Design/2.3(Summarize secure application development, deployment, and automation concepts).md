### Notes:
 -  A software development life cycle (SDLC) divides the creation and maintenance of software into discrete phases. There are two principal SDLCs: the waterfall model and Agile development.
    - Waterfall Model: A software development model where the phases of the SDLC cascade so that each phase will start only when all tasks identified in the previous phase are complete.
    - Agile Dev: A software development model that focuses on iterative and incremental development to account for evolving requirements and expectations.
