### Notes:
 -  A software development life cycle (SDLC) divides the creation and maintenance of software into discrete phases. There are two principal SDLCs: the waterfall model and Agile development.
    - Waterfall Model: A software development model where the phases of the SDLC cascade so that each phase will start only when all tasks identified in the previous phase are complete.
    - Agile Dev: A software development model that focuses on iterative and incremental development to account for evolving requirements and expectations.
 
1.What is secure staging?

 > Creating secure development environments for the different phases of a software development project (initial development server, test/integration server, staging [user test] server, production server).

2.What feature is essential for managing code iterations within the provisioning and deprovisioning processes?

 > Version control is an ID system for each iteration of a software product.

3.Which life cycle process manages continuous release of code to the production environment?

 > Continuous deployment.

4.How does a specially configured compiler inhibit attacks through software diversity?

 > The compiler can apply obfuscation routines to make the code difficult for a threat actor to reverse engineer and analyze for vulnerabilities.
