#### Anything as a Service (XaaS)
 - A broad description of all cloud models
   - Use any combination of the cloud
 - Services delivered over the Internet
   - Not locally hosted or managed
 - Flexible consumption model
 - Any IT Function can be changed into a service

#### Security as a Service (SECaaS)
 - means of implementing a particular security control, such as virus scanning or SIEM-like functionality, in the cloud.

### MSP Support (Managed Service Provider)
 - Cloud Service Provider
 - Not all cloud service providers are MSPs
 - Network Connectivity Management
 - Backups and Disaster Recovery
 - Growth Management and Planning

### MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)
 - Firewall Management
 - Patch Management, security audits
 - Emergency response

## Virtualization Tech and Hypervisor Types

##### Guest OS

##### Type 1 "Bare metal" Hypervisor

## Virtualized vs. Containerized

#### VM Sprawl 
 - Configuration vulnerability where provisioning and deprovisioning of virtual assets is not properly authorized and monitored.

 - Avoidance
   - Virtual machine life cycle management (VMLM) software
   - VMs should conform to an application-specific template with the minimum configuration needed to run that application (that is, not running unnecessary services). 
   - One of the biggest concerns here is of rogue developers or contractors installing backdoors or "logic bombs" within a machine image. 

#### VM Escape
 - An attack where malware running in a VM is able to interact directly with the hypervisor or host kernel.
 - VM escaping refers to malware running on a guest OS jumping to another guest or to the host. 

 - Avoidance
   - Preventing VM escaping is dependent on the virtualization vendor identifying security vulnerabilities in the hypervisor and on these being patched. 
   - The impact of VM escaping can be reduced by using effective service design and network placement when deploying VMs.

# Secure Cloud and Virtualization Services

1.What is meant by a public cloud?

 > A solution hosted by a third-party cloud service provider (CSP) and shared between subscribers (multi-tenant). This sort of cloud solution has the greatest security concerns.

2.What type of cloud solution would be used to implement a SAN?

 > This would usually be described as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

3.What is a Type II hypervisor?

 > Software that manages virtual machines that has been installed to a guest OS. This is in contrast to a Type I (or "bare metal") hypervisor, which interfaces directly with the host hardware.

4.What is a VDE?

 > A Virtual Desktop Environment (VDE) is the workspace presented when accessing an instance in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solution. VDI is the whole solution (host server and virtualization platform, connection protocols, connection/session broker, and client access devices).

5.What is the risk from a VM escaping attack?

 > VM escaping refers to attacking other guest OSes or the hypervisor or host from within a virtual machine. Attacks may be to steal information, perform Denial of Service (DoS), infect the system with malware, and so on.

# Infrastructure as Code

1.A company has been using a custom-developed client-server application for customer management, accessed from remote sites over a VPN. Rapid overseas growth has led to numerous complaints from employees that the system suffers many outages and cannot cope with the increased number of users and access by client devices such as smartphones. What type of architecture could produce a solution that is more scalable?

 > Microservices is a suitable architecture for replacing monolithic client-server applications that do not meet the needs of geographically diverse, mobile workforces. By breaking the application up into microservice components and hosting these in cloud containers, performance can scale to demand. Web-based APIs are better suited to browser-based access on different device types.

2.You have been asked to produce a summary of pros and cons for the products Chef and Puppet. What type of virtualization or cloud computing technology do these support?

 > These are orchestration tools. Orchestration facilitates "automation of automation," ensuring that scripts and API calls are made in the right order and at the right time to support an overall workflow.

3.True or false? Serverless means running computer code on embedded systems.

 > False. With serverless, the provision of functions running in containers is abstracted from the underlying server hardware. The point is that as a consumer, you do not perform any server management. The servers are still present, but they are operated and maintained by the cloud service provider.

4.A company's web services are suffering performance issues because updates keep failing to run on certain systems. What type of architecture could address this issue?

 > Infrastructure as Code (IaC) means that provisioning is performed entirely from standard scripts and configuration data. The absence of manual configuration adjustments or ad hoc scripts to change settings is designed to eliminate configuration drift so that updates run consistently between the development and production environments.

5.What is SDV?

 > Software-defined visibility (SDV) gives API-based access to network infrastructure and hosts so that configuration and state data can be reported in near real time. This facilitates greater automation in models and technologies such as zero trust, inspection of east/west data center traffic, and use of security orchestration and automated response (SOAR) tools.
