#### Anything as a Service (XaaS)
 - A broad description of all cloud models
   - Use any combination of the cloud
 - Services delivered over the Internet
   - Not locally hosted or managed
 - Flexible consumption model
 - Any IT Function can be changed into a service

#### Security as a Service (SECaaS)
 - means of implementing a particular security control, such as virus scanning or SIEM-like functionality, in the cloud.

### MSP Support (Managed Service Provider)
 - Cloud Service Provider
 - Not all cloud service providers are MSPs
 - Network Connectivity Management
 - Backups and Disaster Recovery
 - Growth Management and Planning

### MSSP (Managed Security Service Provider)
 - Firewall Management
 - Patch Management, security audits
 - Emergency response

## Virtualization Tech and Hypervisor Types

##### Guest OS

##### Type 1 "Bare metal" Hypervisor

## Virtualized vs. Containerized

#### VM Sprawl 
 - Configuration vulnerability where provisioning and deprovisioning of virtual assets is not properly authorized and monitored.

 - Avoidance
   - Virtual machine life cycle management (VMLM) software
   - VMs should conform to an application-specific template with the minimum configuration needed to run that application (that is, not running unnecessary services). 
   - One of the biggest concerns here is of rogue developers or contractors installing backdoors or "logic bombs" within a machine image. 

#### VM Escape
 - An attack where malware running in a VM is able to interact directly with the hypervisor or host kernel.
 - VM escaping refers to malware running on a guest OS jumping to another guest or to the host. 

 - Avoidance
   - Preventing VM escaping is dependent on the virtualization vendor identifying security vulnerabilities in the hypervisor and on these being patched. 
   - The impact of VM escaping can be reduced by using effective service design and network placement when deploying VMs.

# Secure Cloud and Virtualization Services

1.What is meant by a public cloud?

 > A solution hosted by a third-party cloud service provider (CSP) and shared between subscribers (multi-tenant). This sort of cloud solution has the greatest security concerns.

2.What type of cloud solution would be used to implement a SAN?

 > This would usually be described as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

3.What is a Type II hypervisor?

 > Software that manages virtual machines that has been installed to a guest OS. This is in contrast to a Type I (or "bare metal") hypervisor, which interfaces directly with the host hardware.

4.What is a VDE?

 > A Virtual Desktop Environment (VDE) is the workspace presented when accessing an instance in a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solution. VDI is the whole solution (host server and virtualization platform, connection protocols, connection/session broker, and client access devices).

5.What is the risk from a VM escaping attack?

 > VM escaping refers to attacking other guest OSes or the hypervisor or host from within a virtual machine. Attacks may be to steal information, perform Denial of Service (DoS), infect the system with malware, and so on.
