#### VM Sprawl 
 - Configuration vulnerability where provisioning and deprovisioning of virtual assets is not properly authorized and monitored.

 - Avoidance
   - Virtual machine life cycle management (VMLM) software
   - VMs should conform to an application-specific template with the minimum configuration needed to run that application (that is, not running unnecessary services). 
   - One of the biggest concerns here is of rogue developers or contractors installing backdoors or "logic bombs" within a machine image.
