# Physical Site Security Controls

1.What physical site security controls act as deterrents?
 > Lighting is one of the most effective deterrents. Any highly visible security control (guards, fences, dogs, barricades, CCTV, signage, and so on) will act as a deterrent.

2.What use might a proximity reader be for site security?
 > One type of proximity reader allows a lock to be operated by a contactless smart card. Proximity sensors can also be used to track objects via RFID tags.

3.What are the two main options for mobile camera surveillance?
 > Robot sentries and drone/UAV-mounted cameras.

4.What physical security system provides mitigation against juice-jacking?
 > A USB data blocker can be attached to the end of a cable to prevent a charging port from trying to make a data connection.


Notes:
 - It is possible to install communications equipment within a shielded enclosure, known as a Faraday Cage. 
 - The cage is a charged conductive mesh that blocks signals from entering or leaving the area. 
 - The risk of eavesdropping from leakage of electromagnetic signals was investigated by the US DoD who defined TEMPEST (Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard) as a means of shielding the signals.Â 


### Secure Data Destruction(Physical)

 - Burning/Incineration
 - Shredding and Pulping
 - Pulverizing - By using a drilling machine
 - Degaussing - exposing a hard disk to a powerful electromagnet disrupts the magnetic pattern that stores the data on the disk surface.
 
### Data Sanitization Tools
 - Secure Erase(SE)
   - the SATA and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) specifications have included a Secure Erase (SE) command. 
   - This command can be invoked using a drive/array utility or the hdparm Linux utility. On HDDs, this performs a single pass of zero-filling.
 - Instant Secure Erase (ISE)
   - HDDs and SSDs that are self-encrypting drives (SEDs) support another option, invoking a SANITIZE command set in SATA and SAS standards from 2012 to perform a crypto erase. 
   - Drive vendors implement this as Instant Secure Erase (ISE).
