The following terminology is used to discuss cryptography: 

 - Plaintext (or cleartext)—an unencrypted message. 
 - Ciphertext—an encrypted message. 
 - Cipher—the process (or algorithm) used to encrypt and decrypt a message. 
 - Cryptanalysis—the art of cracking cryptographic systems. 

### Hashing Algorithm
 -  A cryptographic hashing algorithm produces a fixed length string from an input plaintext that can be of any length. 
 -  The output can be referred to as a checksum, message digest, or hash. 
 -  The function is designed so that it is impossible to recover the plaintext data from the digest (one-way) and so that different inputs are unlikely to produce the same output (a collision).
