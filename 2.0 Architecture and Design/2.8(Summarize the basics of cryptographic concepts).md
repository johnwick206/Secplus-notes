The following terminology is used to discuss cryptography: 

 - Plaintext (or cleartext)—an unencrypted message. 
 - Ciphertext—an encrypted message. 
 - Cipher—the process (or algorithm) used to encrypt and decrypt a message. 
 - Cryptanalysis—the art of cracking cryptographic systems. 

### Hashing Algorithm
 - A cryptographic hashing algorithm produces a fixed length string from an input plaintext that can be of any length. 
 - The output can be referred to as a checksum, message digest, or hash. 
 - The function is designed so that it is impossible to recover the plaintext data from the digest (one-way) and so that different inputs are unlikely to produce the same output (a collision).

### Stream and Block Ciphers
 - Stream Cipher
   - each byte or bit of data in the plaintext is encrypted one at a time.
   - The plaintext is combined with a separate randomly generated message, calculated from the key and an initialization vector (IV). 
   - The IV ensures the key produces a unique ciphertext from the same plaintext. 
   - The keystream must be unique, so an IV must not be reused with the same key.
  
 - Block Cipher
   - In a block cipher, the plaintext is divided into equal-size blocks (usually 128-bit).
   - Each block is then subjected to complex transposition and substitution operations, based on the value of the key used.
  
# Cryptographic Ciphers
1.Which part of a simple cryptographic system must be kept secret—the cipher, the ciphertext, or the key?
 > In cryptography, the security of the message is guaranteed by the security of the key. The system does not depend on hiding the algorithm or the message (security by obscurity).

2.Considering that cryptographic hashing is one-way and the digest cannot be reversed, what makes hashing a useful security technique?
 > Because two parties can hash the same data and compare checksums to see if they match, hashing can be used for data verification in a variety of situations, including password authentication. Hashes of passwords, rather than the password plaintext, can be stored securely or exchanged for authentication. A hash of a file or a hash code in an electronic message can be verified by both parties.

3.Which security property is assured by symmetric encryption?
 > Confidentiality—symmetric ciphers are generally fast and well suited to bulk encrypting large amounts of data.

4.What are the properties of a public/private key pair?
 > Each key can reverse the cryptographic operation performed by its pair but cannot reverse an operation performed by itself. The private key must be kept secret by the owner, but the public key is designed to be widely distributed. The private key cannot be determined from the public key, given a sufficient key size.


### Digital Certificates

 - The process of issuing and verifying certificates is called public key infrastructure (PKI).

### Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
 - This risk from RSA key exchange is mitigated by perfect forward secrecy (PFS). 
 - PFS uses Diffie-Hellman (D-H) key agreement to create ephemeral session keys without using the server's private key. 
 - Diffie-Hellman allows A and B to derive the same shared secret just by agreeing some values that are all related by some trapdoor function. 
 - In the agreement process, they share some of them, but keep others private.
