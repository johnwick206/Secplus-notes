The following terminology is used to discuss cryptography: 

 - Plaintext (or cleartext)—an unencrypted message. 
 - Ciphertext—an encrypted message. 
 - Cipher—the process (or algorithm) used to encrypt and decrypt a message. 
 - Cryptanalysis—the art of cracking cryptographic systems. 

### Hashing Algorithm
 - A cryptographic hashing algorithm produces a fixed length string from an input plaintext that can be of any length. 
 - The output can be referred to as a checksum, message digest, or hash. 
 - The function is designed so that it is impossible to recover the plaintext data from the digest (one-way) and so that different inputs are unlikely to produce the same output (a collision).

### Stream and Block Ciphers
 - Stream Cipher
   - each byte or bit of data in the plaintext is encrypted one at a time.
   - The plaintext is combined with a separate randomly generated message, calculated from the key and an initialization vector (IV). 
   - The IV ensures the key produces a unique ciphertext from the same plaintext. 
   - The keystream must be unique, so an IV must not be reused with the same key.
  
 - Block Cipher
   - In a block cipher, the plaintext is divided into equal-size blocks (usually 128-bit).
   - Each block is then subjected to complex transposition and substitution operations, based on the value of the key used.
