 - If someone wants to establish tunnel with data integrity, encryption, authentication, and anti-replay functions while configuring VPN utilizing IPsec - ESP (Encapsultaing Security Payload) should be used

 - SSO reduces the resiliency and availability of systems if the identity provider goes offline.


 - Role based access control - Lable
 - Discretionary access control - Owner
 - Mandatory Based access control - Computer (Strongest)
 - Attribute-based access control - Dynamic, If-then ( provides the most detailed and explicit type of access control over a resource )


 - Security control for Backup generators would be a Compensating control type
   - Compensating doesn't prevent an attack
   - Restoring using other means
   - Restore from backup
   - Backup power system
   - Hot site

 - Data sovereignty - Data that resides in a country is subject to the laws of that country.

 - Spimming - Spim is a type of spam targeting users of instant messaging (IM) services, SMS, or private messages within websites and social media.

 - Vulnerability + Threat = Risk

 - Conduct credentialed scan to most accurately determine the network's vulnerability posture. In most enterprise networks, if a vulnerability exists on one machine, it also exists on most other workstations since they use a common baseline or image. If the scanner failed to connect to the workstations, an error would have been generated in the report.

 - PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an asymmetric

 - Network Tap is a Passive type of monitoring.

 - Relying parties (RPs) provide services to members of a federation. 
 - An identity provider (IdP) provides identities, makes assertions about those identities, and releases information about the identity holders.

 -  DNS blackholing is a process that uses a list of known domains/IP addresses belonging to malicious hosts and uses an internal DNS server to create a fake reply

 - Banner Grabbing is a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports.

 - Passive scanning is a method of vulnerability detection that relies on information gleaned from network data that is captured from a target computer without direct interaction.
 - PIV - Personal Identity Verification

 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) -  utilizes a well-written set of carefully developed and tested scripts to orchestrate runbooks and generate consistent server builds across an enterprise.

 - A jumpbox is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. This would create network segmentation between the supplier's laptops and the rest of the network to minimize the risk. A jump-box system is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them.

 - Order of Evidence Collection:
   Processor Cache > RAM > Swap file > Hard Drive or USB Drive
 - War walking - act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks

 - Degaussing is the process of reducing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field (or data) stored on tape
 -  Purging is a step up from clearing. It includes using logical methods, like above, and physical methods to make it hard to recover data.

 - DPO (Data Protection Officer) -  responsible for overseeing data protection strategy and implementation to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.
 - Data Owner - responsible for the protection of privacy and website user rights.
 - Data Steward/Custodian - is related to the storage, aggregation and the use of data sets
