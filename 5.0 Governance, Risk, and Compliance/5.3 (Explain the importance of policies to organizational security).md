# Importance of Personnel Policies

1.Your company has been the victim of several successful phishing attempts over the past year. Attackers managed to steal credentials from these attacks and used them to compromise key systems. What vulnerability contributed to the success of these social engineers, and why?
 > A lack of proper user training directly contributes to the success of social engineering attempts. Attackers can easily trick users when those users are unfamiliar with the characteristics and ramifications of such deception.

2.Why should an organization design role-based training programs?
 > Employees have different levels of technical knowledge and different work priorities. This means that a "one size fits all" approach to security training is impractical.

3.You are planning a security awareness program for a manufacturer. Is a pamphlet likely to be sufficient in terms of resources?
 > Using a diversity of training techniques will boost engagement and retention. Practical tasks, such as phishing simulations, will give attendees more direct experience. Workshops or computer-based training will make it easier to assess whether the training has been completed.
