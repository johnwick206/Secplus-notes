## Risk Types

 - External - External threat actors are one highly-visible source of risk. The most critical type of impact is one that could lead to loss of life or critical injury.
 - Internal - Internal risks come from assets and workflows that are owned and managed by your organization
 - Multiparty - Multiparty risk usually arises from supplier relationships. If a critical event disrupts a supplier or customer, then your own organization will suffer. 
 - Intellectual Property (IP) Theft - Intellectual property (IP) is data of commercial value that is owned by the organization. This can mean copyrighted material for retail (software, written work, video, and music) and product designs and patents.
 - Software Compliance/Licensing - Breaking the terms of athe end user licensing agreement (EULA) that imposes conditions on installation of the software can expose the computer owner to substantial fines.
 - Legacy Systems - Legacy systems are a source of risk because they no longer receive security updates and because the expertise to maintain and troubleshoot them is a scarce resource.

## Quantitative Risk Assessment

**Quantitative risk assessment aims to assign concrete values to each risk factor.**
 - Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)—The amount that would be lost in a single occurrence of the risk factor. This is determined by multiplying the value of the asset by an Exposure Factor (EF). EF is the percentage of the asset value that would be lost.
 - Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)—The amount that would be lost over the course of a year. This is determined by multiplying the SLE by the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO).

## Qualitative Risk Assessment

 - focused on identifying significant risk factors. 
 - The qualitative approach seeks out people's opinions of which risk factors are significant. 
 - Assets and risks may be placed in simple categories.
