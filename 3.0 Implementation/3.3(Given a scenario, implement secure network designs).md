## Routing and Switching Protocols - A number of routing and switching protocols are used to implement forwarding. The forwarding function takes place at two different layers:

 - Layer 2 forwarding occurs between nodes on the same local network segment that are all in the same broadcast domain. 
   - At layer 2, each node is identified by the network interface's hardware or Media Access Control (MAC) address. 
 - Layer 3 forwarding, or routing, occurs between both logically and physically defined networks. 
   - A single network divided into multiple logical broadcast domains is said to be subnetted. 
   - Multiple networks joined by routers form an internetwork. 
   - At layer 3, nodes are identified by an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

#### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) maps a network interface's hardware (MAC) address to an IP address. 

#### Internet Protocol (IP) - IP provides the addressing mechanism for logical networks and subnets.

## Routing Protocols -Allows a router to perform dynamic updates to its routing table based on route data exchanged with other routers.
**Some Routing Protocols are:**
### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - A path vector routing protocol used by ISPs to establish routing between one another.
### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) - A link-state routing protocol used on IP networks
### Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) - IGRP is a distance vector-based routing protocol using a metric composed of several administrator weighted elements including reliability, bandwidth, delay, and load. E(nhanced)IGRP, the version now in use, supports classless addressing and more efficient route selection.
### Routing Information Protocol (RIP) - A distance vector-based routing protocol that uses a hop count to determine the distance to the destination network. 


## Demilitarized Zone Topologies

### Screened Subnet
 - A screened subnet uses two firewalls placed on either side of the DMZ. 
 - The edge firewall restricts traffic on the external/public interface and allows permitted traffic to the hosts in the DMZ. 
 - The edge firewall can be referred to as the screening firewall or router.
 - The internal firewall filters communications between hosts in the DMZ and hosts on the LAN. 
 - This firewall is often described as the choke firewall. 
 - A choke point is a purposefully narrow gateway that facilitates better access control and easier monitoring.

### Triple-Homed Firewall
 - A DMZ can also be established using one router/firewall appliance with three network interfaces, referred to as triple-homed. One interface is the public one, another is the DMZ, and the third connects to the LAN. 
 - Routing and filtering rules determine what forwarding is allowed between these interfaces. 
 - This can achieve the same sort of configuration as a screened subnet.

## Screened Hosts
 - maller networks may not have the budget or technical expertise to implement a DMZ. 
 - In this case, Internet access can still be implemented using a dual-homed proxy/gateway server acting as a screened host.

## East-West and North-South TrafficL
 - Traffic that goes to and from a data center is referred to as north-south. 
   - This traffic represents clients outside the data center making requests and receiving responses. 
 - In data centers that support cloud and other Internet services, most traffic is actually between servers within the data center. This is referred to as east-west traffic.

## Zero Trust 
**Security design paradigm where any request (host-to-host or container-to-container) must be authenticated before being allowed.**
 - Zero trust is based on the idea that perimeter security is unlikely to be completely robust.
 - Zero trust uses systems such as continuous authentication and conditional access to mitigate privilege escalation and account compromise by threat actors.
