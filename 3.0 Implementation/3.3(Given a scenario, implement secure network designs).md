## Routing and Switching Protocols - A number of routing and switching protocols are used to implement forwarding. The forwarding function takes place at two different layers:

 - Layer 2 forwarding occurs between nodes on the same local network segment that are all in the same broadcast domain. 
   - At layer 2, each node is identified by the network interface's hardware or Media Access Control (MAC) address. 
 - Layer 3 forwarding, or routing, occurs between both logically and physically defined networks. 
   - A single network divided into multiple logical broadcast domains is said to be subnetted. 
   - Multiple networks joined by routers form an internetwork. 
   - At layer 3, nodes are identified by an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

#### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) - The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) maps a network interface's hardware (MAC) address to an IP address. 

#### Internet Protocol (IP) - IP provides the addressing mechanism for logical networks and subnets.

## Routing Protocols -Allows a router to perform dynamic updates to its routing table based on route data exchanged with other routers.
**Some Routing Protocols are:**
### Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - A path vector routing protocol used by ISPs to establish routing between one another.
### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) - A link-state routing protocol used on IP networks
### Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) - IGRP is a distance vector-based routing protocol using a metric composed of several administrator weighted elements including reliability, bandwidth, delay, and load. E(nhanced)IGRP, the version now in use, supports classless addressing and more efficient route selection.
### Routing Information Protocol (RIP) - A distance vector-based routing protocol that uses a hop count to determine the distance to the destination network.
