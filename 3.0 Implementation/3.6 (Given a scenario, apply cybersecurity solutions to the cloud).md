## Cloud Security Controls
 
 - Clouds use the same types of security controls as on-premises networks, including identity and access management (IAM), endpoint protection (for virtual instances), resource policies to govern access to data and services, firewalls to filter traffic between hosts, and logging to provide an audit function.


### Application Security and IAM

 -  Application security in the cloud refers both to the software development process and to identity and access management (IAM) features designed to ensure authorized use of applications.

### Secrets Management

 - A cloud service is highly vulnerable to remote access. A failure of credential management is likely to be exploited by malicious actors. You must enforce strong authentication policies to mitigate risks:
   - Do not use the root user for the CSP account for any day-to-day logon activity.
   - Require strong multifactor authentication (MFA) for interactive logons. Use conditional authentication to deny or warn of risky account activity.
   - Principals—user accounts, security groups, roles, and services—can interact with cloud services via CLIs and APIs.

## Cloud Compute Security

 - Cloud provides resources abstracted from physical hardware via one or more layers of virtualization. 
 - The compute component provides process and system memory (RAM) resource as required for a particular workload. 

### Container Security

 - each container is isolated from others through separate namespaces and control groups.
 - Namespaces prevent one container reading or writing processes in another, while control groups ensure that one container cannot overwhelm others in a DoS-type attack.

### API Inspection and Integration

 - Monitoring API usage gives warning if the system is becoming overloaded (ensuring availability) and allows detection of unauthorized usage or attempted usage.
   - Number of requests
   - Latency
   - Error Rates
   - Unauthorized and suspicious endpoints

### Instance Awareness

 - As with on-premises virtualization, it is important to manage instances (virtual machines and containers) to avoid sprawl, where undocumented instances are launched and left unmanaged. 
 - As well as restricting rights to launch instances, you should configure logging and monitoring to track usage.

## Cloud Storage Security

 - Storage profiles will have different performance characteristics for different applications, such as fast SSD-backed storage for databases versus slower HDD-backed media for archiving. 
 - The principal performance metric is the number of input/output operations per second (IOPS) supported.

### Permissions and Resource Policies

 - As with on-premises systems, cloud storage resources must be configured to allow reads and/or writes only from authorized endpoints. 
 - In the cloud, a resource policy acts as the ACL for an object.

### Encryption 

 -  Cloud storage encryption equates to the on-premises concept of full disk encryption (FDE). 
 -  Each storage unit is encrypted using an AES key. 
 -  To read or write the data, the AES key must be available to the VM or container using the storage object. 
 -  The key will be stored in a hardware security module (HSM) within the cloud. 
 -  The HSM and separation of duties policies protect the keys from insider threat.

## High Availability

### Replication

 - Data replication allows businesses to copy data to where it can be utilized most effectively.
 - The terms hot and cold storage refer to how quickly data is retrieved. 
   - Hot storage retrieves data more quickly than cold, but the quicker the data retrieval, the higher the cost. 
 - A database generally needs low-latency, synchronous replication, as a transaction often cannot be considered complete until it has been made on all replicas. 

### High Availability across Zones

 - CSPs offer several tiers of replication representing different high availability service levels:
   - Local Replication
   - Regional Replication
   - Geo-Redundant Replication (GRS)
