## Cloud Security Controls
 
 - Clouds use the same types of security controls as on-premises networks, including identity and access management (IAM), endpoint protection (for virtual instances), resource policies to govern access to data and services, firewalls to filter traffic between hosts, and logging to provide an audit function.


### Application Security and IAM

 -  Application security in the cloud refers both to the software development process and to identity and access management (IAM) features designed to ensure authorized use of applications.

### Secrets Management

 - A cloud service is highly vulnerable to remote access. A failure of credential management is likely to be exploited by malicious actors. You must enforce strong authentication policies to mitigate risks:
   - Do not use the root user for the CSP account for any day-to-day logon activity.
   - Require strong multifactor authentication (MFA) for interactive logons. Use conditional authentication to deny or warn of risky account activity.
   - Principals—user accounts, security groups, roles, and services—can interact with cloud services via CLIs and APIs.
