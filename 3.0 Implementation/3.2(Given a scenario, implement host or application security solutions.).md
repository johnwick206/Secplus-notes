### Hardening
 - The process of putting an operating system or application in a secure configuration is called hardening. 
 - When hardening a system, it is important to keep in mind its intended use, because hardening a system can also restrict the system's access and capabilities.

## Endpoint Protection

### AntiVirus (A-V)/Anti-Malware:
 - An "A-V" product will now perform generalized malware detection, meaning not just viruses and worms, but also Trojans, spyware, PUPs, cryptojackers, and so on. 

### Host-Based Intrusion Detection/Prevention (HIDS/HIPS)
 - Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) provides threat detection via log and file system monitoring. 
 - HIDS comes in many different forms with different capabilities, some of them preventative (HIPS).
 - File system integrity monitoring uses signatures to detect whether a managed file image—such as an OS system file, driver, or application executable—has changed. 
 - Products may also monitor ports and network interfaces, and process data and logs generated by specific applications, such as HTTP or FTP.

### Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP):
 - An endpoint protection platform (EPP) is a single agent performing multiple security tasks, including malware/intrusion detection and prevention, but also other security features, such as a host firewall, web content filtering/secure search and browsing, and file/message encryption. 

### Data loss Prevention (DLP):
 - Many EPPs include a data loss prevention (DLP) agent. 
 - The agent enforces the policy to prevent data from being copied or attached to a message without authorization.

## Next-Gen Endpoint Protection

### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
 - An endpoint detection and response (EDR) product's aim is not to prevent initial execution, but to provide real-time and historical visibility into the compromise, contain the malware within a single host, and facilitate remediation of the host to its original state. 

### Next-Generation Firewall Integration
 - An analytics-driven next-gen antivirus product is likely to combine with the perimeter and zonal security offered by next-gen firewalls.

# Endpoint Security
What is a hardened configuration?
 > A basic principle of security is to run only services that are needed. A hardened system is configured to perform a role as client or application server with the minimal possible attack surface, in terms of interfaces, ports, services, storage, system/registry permissions, lack of security controls, and vulnerabilities.

2.True or false? Only Microsoft's operating systems and applications require security patches.
 > False—any vendor's or open-source software or firmware can contain vulnerabilities that need patching.

3.Antivirus software has reported the presence of malware but cannot remove it automatically. Apart from the location of the affected file, what information will you need to remediate the system manually?
 > The string identifying the malware. You can use this to reference the malware on the A-V vendor's site and, hopefully, obtain manual removal and prevention advice.

4.You are consulting with a medium-size company about endpoint security solutions. What advantages does a cloud-based analytics platform have over an on-premises solution that relies on signature updates?
 > Advanced persistent threat (APT) malware can use many techniques to evade signature-based detection. A cloud analytics platform, backed by machine learning, can apply more effective behavioral-based monitoring and alerting.

5.If you suspect a process of being used for data exfiltration but the process is not identified as malware by A-V software, what types of analysis tools will be most useful?
 > You can use a sandbox with monitoring tools to see which files the process interacts with and a network monitor to see if it opens (or tries to open) a connection with a remote host.
