## Kerberos Authentication

 - Kerberos is a single sign-on network authentication and authorization protocol used on many networks, notably as implemented by Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) service.
 - Clients request services from application servers, which both rely on an intermediary—a Key Distribution Center (KDC)—to vouch for their identity. 
 - There are two services that make up a KDC: the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service. 
 - The TGT is an example of a logical token. All the TGT does is identify who you are and confirm that you have been authenticated—it does not provide you with access to any domain resources.

# Knowledge Based Authentication

1.Why might a PIN be a particularly weak type of something you know authentication?
 > A long personal identification number (PIN) is difficult for users to remember, but a short PIN is easy to crack. A PIN can only be used safely where the number of sequential authentication attempts can be strictly limited.

2.In what scenario would PAP be considered a secure authentication method?
 > PAP is a legacy protocol that cannot be considered secure because it transmits plaintext ASCII passwords and has no cryptographic protection. The only way to ensure the security of PAP is to ensure that the endpoints established a secure tunnel (using IPSec, for instance).

3.True or false? In order to create a service ticket, Kerberos passes the user's password to the target application server for authentication.
 > False—only the KDC verifies the user credential. The Ticket Granting Service (TGS) sends the user's account details (SID) to the target application for authorization (allocation of permissions), not authentication.

4.A user maintains a list of commonly used passwords in a file located deep within the computer's directory structure. Is this secure password management?
 > No. This is security by obscurity. The file could probably be easily discovered using search tools.

5.Which property of a plaintext password is most effective at defeating a brute-force attack?
 > The length of the password. If the password does not have any complexity (if it is just two dictionary words, for instance), it may still be vulnerable to a dictionary-based attack. A long password may still be vulnerable if the output space is small or if the mechanism used to hash the password is faulty (LM hashes being one example).


## Key Management Devices

 - A hardware security module (HSM) is a network appliance designed to perform centralized PKI management for a network of devices. 
 - HSM - An appliance for generating and storing cryptographic keys. This sort of solution may be less susceptible to tampering and insider threats than software-based storage.

## Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)/IEEE 802.1X

 -  Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework for deploying multiple types of authentication protocols and technologies. 
 -  EAP allows lots of different authentication methods, but many of them use a digital certificate on the server and/or client 
machines.
 - the IEEE 802.1X Port-based Network Access Control (NAC) protocol provides the means of using an EAP method when a device connects to an Ethernet switch port, wireless access point (with enterprise authentication configured), or VPN gateway. 
 - 802.1X uses authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) architecture.

## Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service

 - The Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) standard is published as an Internet standard. There are several RADIUS server and client products.
 - The NAS device (RADIUS client) is configured with the IP address of the RADIUS server and with a shared secret. 
 - This allows the client to authenticate to the server. Remember that the client is the access device (switch, access point, or VPN gateway), not the user's PC or laptop.
