## Kerberos Authentication

 - Kerberos is a single sign-on network authentication and authorization protocol used on many networks, notably as implemented by Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) service.
 - Clients request services from application servers, which both rely on an intermediary—a Key Distribution Center (KDC)—to vouch for their identity. 
 - There are two services that make up a KDC: the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service. 
 - The TGT is an example of a logical token. All the TGT does is identify who you are and confirm that you have been authenticated—it does not provide you with access to any domain resources.
