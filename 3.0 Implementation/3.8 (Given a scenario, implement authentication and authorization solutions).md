## Kerberos Authentication

 - Kerberos is a single sign-on network authentication and authorization protocol used on many networks, notably as implemented by Microsoft's Active Directory (AD) service.
 - Clients request services from application servers, which both rely on an intermediary—a Key Distribution Center (KDC)—to vouch for their identity. 
 - There are two services that make up a KDC: the Authentication Service and the Ticket Granting Service. 
 - The TGT is an example of a logical token. All the TGT does is identify who you are and confirm that you have been authenticated—it does not provide you with access to any domain resources.

# Knowledge Based Authentication

1.Why might a PIN be a particularly weak type of something you know authentication?
 > A long personal identification number (PIN) is difficult for users to remember, but a short PIN is easy to crack. A PIN can only be used safely where the number of sequential authentication attempts can be strictly limited.

2.In what scenario would PAP be considered a secure authentication method?
 > PAP is a legacy protocol that cannot be considered secure because it transmits plaintext ASCII passwords and has no cryptographic protection. The only way to ensure the security of PAP is to ensure that the endpoints established a secure tunnel (using IPSec, for instance).

3.True or false? In order to create a service ticket, Kerberos passes the user's password to the target application server for authentication.
 > False—only the KDC verifies the user credential. The Ticket Granting Service (TGS) sends the user's account details (SID) to the target application for authorization (allocation of permissions), not authentication.

4.A user maintains a list of commonly used passwords in a file located deep within the computer's directory structure. Is this secure password management?
 > No. This is security by obscurity. The file could probably be easily discovered using search tools.

5.Which property of a plaintext password is most effective at defeating a brute-force attack?
 > The length of the password. If the password does not have any complexity (if it is just two dictionary words, for instance), it may still be vulnerable to a dictionary-based attack. A long password may still be vulnerable if the output space is small or if the mechanism used to hash the password is faulty (LM hashes being one example).


## Key Management Devices

 - A hardware security module (HSM) is a network appliance designed to perform centralized PKI management for a network of devices. 
 - HSM - An appliance for generating and storing cryptographic keys. This sort of solution may be less susceptible to tampering and insider threats than software-based storage.

## Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)/IEEE 802.1X

 -  Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework for deploying multiple types of authentication protocols and technologies. 
 -  EAP allows lots of different authentication methods, but many of them use a digital certificate on the server and/or client 
machines.
 - the IEEE 802.1X Port-based Network Access Control (NAC) protocol provides the means of using an EAP method when a device connects to an Ethernet switch port, wireless access point (with enterprise authentication configured), or VPN gateway. 
 - 802.1X uses authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) architecture.

## Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service

 - The Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) standard is published as an Internet standard. There are several RADIUS server and client products.
 - The NAS device (RADIUS client) is configured with the IP address of the RADIUS server and with a shared secret. 
 - This allows the client to authenticate to the server. Remember that the client is the access device (switch, access point, or VPN gateway), not the user's PC or laptop.

## Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System (Developed by Cisco)

 - Uses port 49
 - All the data in TACACS+ packets is encrypted (except for the header identifying the packet as TACACS+ data), rather than just the authentication data. This ensures confidentiality and integrity when transferring critical network infrastructure data.
 - Authentication, authorization, and accounting functions are discrete.

# Authentication Technologies

1.True or false? When implementing smart card logon, the user's private key is stored on the smart card.
 > True. The smart card implements a cryptoprocessor for secure generation and storage of key and certificate material.

2.You are providing consultancy to a firm to help them implement smart card authentication to premises networks and cloud services. What are the main advantages of using an HSM over server-based key and certificate management services?
 > A hardware security module (HSM) is optimized for this role and so present a smaller attack surface. It is designed to be tamper-evident to mitigate against insider threat risks. It is also likely to have a better implementation of a random number generator, improving the security properties of key material.

3.Which network access control framework supports smart cards?
 > Local logon providers, such as Kerberos, support smart cards, but this is not network access control as the device has already been allowed on the network. The IEEE 802.1X framework means that network access servers (switches, access points, and VPN gateways) can accept Extensible Authentication Protocols (EAP) credentials, but block any other type of network access. They act as pass-thru for an authentication server, which stores and validates the credentials. Some EAP types support smart card or machine authentication.

4.What is a RADIUS client?
 > A device or server that accepts user connections, often referred to as a network access server (NAS) or as the authenticator. Using RADIUS architecture, the client does not need to be able to perform authentication itself; it performs pass-thru to an AAA server.

5.What is EAPoL?
 > A network access server that support 802.1X port-based access control can enable a port but allow only the transfer of Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPoL) traffic. This allows the supplicant and authentication server to perform the authentication process, with the network access server acting as a pass-thru.

6.How does OTP protect against password guessing or sniffing attacks?
 > A one-time password mechanism generates a token that is valid only for a short period (usually 60 seconds), before it changes again.

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

 - Discretionary access control (DAC) is based on the primacy of the resource owner. 
 - The owner is originally the creator of a file or service, though ownership can be assigned to another user.
 - DAC is the most flexible model and is currently implemented widely in terms of computer and network security. 
 - In terms of file system security, it is the model used by default for most UNIX/Linux distributions and by Microsoft Windows.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

 - An access control model where resources are protected by ACLs that are managed by administrators and that provide user permissions based on job functions.
 - the right to modify roles is reserved to a system owner.
