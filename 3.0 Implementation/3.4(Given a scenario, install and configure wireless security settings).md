### Wireless Access Point (WAP) Placement
 - Each WAP is identified by its MAC address, also referred to as its basic service set identifier (BSSID). 
 - Each wireless network is identified by its name, or service set identifier (SSID).

### Wifi Protected Access
 - version 1 of WPA uses the RC4 stream cipher but adds a mechanism called the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to make it stronger.
 - WPA2 uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher with 128-bit keys, deployed within the Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP).

### WPA3
 - Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)—replaces WPA's 4-way handshake authentication and association mechanism with a protocol based on Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
 - Enhanced Open—enables encryption for the open authentication method.
 - Updated cryptographic protocols—replaces AES CCMP with the AES Galois Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP) mode of operation. Enterprise authentication methods must use 192-bit AES, while personal authentication can use either 128-bit or 192-bit.
 - Management protection frames—mandates use of these to protect against key recovery attacks.

### Easy Connect Method
 - The Easy Connect method, announced alongside WPA3, is intended to replace WPS as a method of securely configuring client devices with the information required to access a Wi-Fi network. 
 - Easy Connect is a brand name for the Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP). 
 - Each participating device must be configured with a public/private key pair. 
 - Easy Connect uses quick response (QR) codes or near field communication (NFC) tags to communicate each device's public key.
 
 #### WPA3 can implement a mode called Wi-Fi Enhanced Open, which uses opportunistic wireless encryption (OWE). OWE uses the Dragonfly handshake to agree ephemeral session keys on joining the network. 
 
 ### Enterprise/IEEE 802.1X Authentication
  - As an alternative to personal authentication, the enterprise authentication method implements IEEE 802.1X to use an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) mechanism. 
  - 802.1X defines the use of EAP over Wireless (EAPoW) to allow an access point to forward authentication data without allowing any other type of network access. 
  - It is configured by selecting WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3-Enterprise as the security method on the access point.

### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
 - defines a framework for negotiating authentication mechanisms rather than the details of the mechanisms themselves. 
 - Vendors can write extensions to the protocol to support third-party security devices. 
 - EAP implementations can include smart cards, one-time passwords, biometric identifiers, or simpler username and password combinations.
 - EAP-TLS is one of the strongest types of authentication and is very widely supported. 
 - An encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel is established between the supplicant and authentication server using public key certificates on the authentication server and supplicant.
