## Mobile Device Deployment Models

 - BYOD (Bring your Own Device) - the mobile device is owned by the employee. 
 - COBO (Corporate Owned, buisness only) - the device is the property of the company and may only be used for company business.
 - COPE (Corporate owned, personally-enabled) - the device is chosen and supplied by the company and remains its property. 
 - CYOD (Choose your own device) - much the same as COPE but the employee is given a choice of device from a list.
