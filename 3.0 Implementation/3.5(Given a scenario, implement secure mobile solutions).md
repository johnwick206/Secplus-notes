## Mobile Device Deployment Models

 - BYOD (Bring your Own Device) - the mobile device is owned by the employee. 
 - COBO (Corporate Owned, buisness only) - the device is the property of the company and may only be used for company business.
 - COPE (Corporate owned, personally-enabled) - the device is chosen and supplied by the company and remains its property. 
 - CYOD (Choose your own device) - much the same as COPE but the employee is given a choice of device from a list.

## Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)
 
 - Mobile device management (MDM) - sets device policies for authentication, feature use (camera and microphone), and connectivity. MDM can also allow device resets and remote wipes.
 - Mobile application management (MAM) - sets policies for apps that can process corporate data, and prevents data transfer to personal apps.
 - Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) - Enterprise software for controlling device settings, apps, and corporate data storage on all types of fixed, mobile, and IoT computing devices.

#### Indoor Positioning System (IPS) - works out a device's location by triangulating its proximity to other radio sources, such as cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and Bluetooth/RFID beacons.

## Geofencing

 - Geofencing is the practice of creating a virtual boundary based on real-world geography. 
 - Geofencing can be a useful tool with respect to controlling the use of camera or video functions or applying context-aware authentication.
