## Digital Certificates

 - An X.509 digital certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) as a guarantee that a public key it has issued to an organization to encrypt messages sent to it genuinely belongs to that organization.
 - The certificate is digitally signed to prove that it was issued to the subject by a particular CA.

## Web Server Certificate Types

 - Domain Validation (DV)—proving the ownership of a particular domain. 
   - This may be proved by responding to an email to the authorized domain contact or by publishing a text record to the domain.      - This process can be highly vulnerable to compromise. 
 - Extended Validation (EV)—subjecting to a process that requires more rigorous checks on the subject's legal identity and control over the domain or software being signed. 
   - EV standards are maintained by the CA/Browser forum (cabforum.org). 
   - An EV certificate cannot be issued for a wildcard domain.
