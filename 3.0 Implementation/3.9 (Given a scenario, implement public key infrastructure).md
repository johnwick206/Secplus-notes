## Digital Certificates

 - An X.509 digital certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) as a guarantee that a public key it has issued to an organization to encrypt messages sent to it genuinely belongs to that organization.
 - The certificate is digitally signed to prove that it was issued to the subject by a particular CA. 

## Certificate Attributes

## Web Server Certificate Types

 - Domain Validation (DV)—proving the ownership of a particular domain. 
   - This may be proved by responding to an email to the authorized domain contact or by publishing a text record to the domain.      - This process can be highly vulnerable to compromise. 
 - Extended Validation (EV)—subjecting to a process that requires more rigorous checks on the subject's legal identity and control over the domain or software being signed. 
   - EV standards are maintained by the CA/Browser forum (cabforum.org). 
   - An EV certificate cannot be issued for a wildcard domain.

# Certificates and Certificate Authorities

1.What is the main weakness of a hierarchical trust model?
 > The structure depends on the integrity of the root CA.

2.How does a subject go about obtaining a certificate from a CA?
 > In most cases, the subject generates a key pair then adds the public key along with subject information and certificate type in a certificate signing request (CSR) and submits it to the CA. If the CA accepts the request, it generates a certificate with the appropriate key usage and validity, signs it, and transmits it to the subject.

3.What cryptographic information is stored in a digital certificate?
 > The subject's public key and the algorithms used for encryption and hashing. The certificate also stores a digital signature from the issuing CA, establishing the chain of trust.

4.What does it mean if a certificate extension attribute is marked as critical?
 > That the application processing the certificate must be able to interpret the extension correctly. Otherwise, it should reject the certificate.

5.You are developing a secure web application. What sort of certificate should you request to show that you are the publisher of a program?
 > A code signing certificate. Certificates are issued for specific purposes. A certificate issued for one purpose should not be reused for other functions.

6.What extension field is used with a web server certificate to support the identification of the server by multiple specific subdomain labels?
 > The subject alternative name (SAN) field. A wildcard certificate will match any subdomain label.


## Key Recovery and Escrow

 - Access to critical encryption keys must be logged and audited and is typically subject to M-of-N control, meaning that of N number of administrators permitted to access the system, M must be present for access to be granted. M must be greater than 1, and N must be greater than M. 
 - Escrow - In key management, the storage of a backup key with a third party.
   - This is a useful solution for organizations that don't have the capability to store keys securely themselves, but it invests a great deal of trust in the third party.

## Certificate Revocation Lists

 - A certificate may be revoked or suspended:
   - A revoked certificate is no longer valid and cannot be "un-revoked" or reinstated.
   - A suspended certificate can be re-enabled.
 - CAs must maintain a certificate revocation list (CRL) of all revoked and suspended certificates, which can be distributed throughout the hierarchy. 

## Certificate Formats

### Encoding
 - Cryptographic data—both certificates and keys—are processed as binary using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).
 - the binary data is represented as ASCII text characters using Base64 Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) encoding. ASCII-format data has descriptive headers, such as the "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" string.

### File Extensions
 - A three character file extension is a convention, not a standard, and unfortunately file extensions do not always map cleanly to the type of encoding used within a certificate file, or even to the contents of a certificate file.
 - Both .DER and .PEM can be used as file extensions, although the latter is not recognized by Windows. .PEM is the the most widely used extension for ASCII format files in Linux.
 - The .CRT and .CER extensions can also be used, but they they are not well-standardized. 
   - In Linux, .CRT is most likely to represent an ASCII certificate. 
   - In Windows, the most common extension is .CER, but this does not tell you whether the file format is binary or ASCII.

### Contents
 - The PKCS #12 format allows the export of the private key with the certificate. 
   - This would be used either to transfer a private key to a host that could not generate its own keys, or to back up/archive a private key.
   - On Windows, these usually have a .PFX extension, while MacOS and iOS use .P12. 
   - In Linux, the certificate and key are usually stored in separate files.
 - The P7B format implements PKCS #7, which is a means of bundling multiple certificates in the same file.
   - This is most often used to deliver a chain of certificates that must be trusted by the processing host. 
   - It is associated with the use of S/MIME to encrypt email messages. 
   - P7B files do not contain the private key. 
   - In Linux, the .PEM extension is very widely used for certificate chains.

# PKI Management

What are the potential consequences if a company loses control of a private key?
 > It puts both data confidentiality and identification and authentication systems at risk. Depending on the key usage, the key may be used to decrypt data with authorization. The key could also be used to impersonate a user or computer account.

2.You are advising a customer about encryption for data backup security and the key escrow services that you offer. How should you explain the risks of key escrow and potential mitigations?
 > Escrow refers to archiving the key used to encrypt the customer's backups with your company as a third party. The risk is that an insider attack from your company may be able to decrypt the data backups. This risk can be mitigated by requiring M-of-N access to the escrow keys, reducing the risk of a rogue administrator.

3.What mechanism informs clients about suspended or revoked keys?
 > Either a published Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder.

4.What mechanism does HPKP implement?
 > HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) ensures that when a client inspects the certificate presented by a server or a code-signed application, it is inspecting the proper certificate by submitting one or more public keys to an HTTP browser via an HTTP header.

5.What type of certificate format can be used if you want to transfer your private key and certificate from one Windows host computer to another?
 > PKCS #12 / .PFX / .P12.

6.What type of operation is being performed by the following command?
openssl req -nodes -new -newkey rsa:2048 -out my.csr -keyout mykey.pem

 > This generates a new RSA key pair plus a certificate signing request.
