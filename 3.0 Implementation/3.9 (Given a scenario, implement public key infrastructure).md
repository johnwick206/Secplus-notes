## Digital Certificates

 - An X.509 digital certificate is issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) as a guarantee that a public key it has issued to an organization to encrypt messages sent to it genuinely belongs to that organization.
 - The certificate is digitally signed to prove that it was issued to the subject by a particular CA. 

## Certificate Attributes

## Web Server Certificate Types

 - Domain Validation (DV)—proving the ownership of a particular domain. 
   - This may be proved by responding to an email to the authorized domain contact or by publishing a text record to the domain.      - This process can be highly vulnerable to compromise. 
 - Extended Validation (EV)—subjecting to a process that requires more rigorous checks on the subject's legal identity and control over the domain or software being signed. 
   - EV standards are maintained by the CA/Browser forum (cabforum.org). 
   - An EV certificate cannot be issued for a wildcard domain.

# Certificates and Certificate Authorities

1.What is the main weakness of a hierarchical trust model?
 > The structure depends on the integrity of the root CA.

2.How does a subject go about obtaining a certificate from a CA?
 > In most cases, the subject generates a key pair then adds the public key along with subject information and certificate type in a certificate signing request (CSR) and submits it to the CA. If the CA accepts the request, it generates a certificate with the appropriate key usage and validity, signs it, and transmits it to the subject.

3.What cryptographic information is stored in a digital certificate?
 > The subject's public key and the algorithms used for encryption and hashing. The certificate also stores a digital signature from the issuing CA, establishing the chain of trust.

4.What does it mean if a certificate extension attribute is marked as critical?
 > That the application processing the certificate must be able to interpret the extension correctly. Otherwise, it should reject the certificate.

5.You are developing a secure web application. What sort of certificate should you request to show that you are the publisher of a program?
 > A code signing certificate. Certificates are issued for specific purposes. A certificate issued for one purpose should not be reused for other functions.

6.What extension field is used with a web server certificate to support the identification of the server by multiple specific subdomain labels?
 > The subject alternative name (SAN) field. A wildcard certificate will match any subdomain label.
