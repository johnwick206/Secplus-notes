### Network Address Allocation (DHCP)

 - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides an automatic method for network address allocation. 
 - The key point about DHCP is that only one server should be offering addresses to any one group of hosts. 
 - If a rogue DHCP server is set up, it can perform DoS (as client machines will obtain an incorrect TCP/IP configuration) or be used to snoop network information. 
 - DHCP starvation is a type of DoS attack where a rogue client repeatedly requests new IP addresses using spoofed MAC addresses, with the aim of exhausting the IP address pool.

### DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)
 - help to mitigate against spoofing and poisoning attacks by providing a validation process for DNS responses. 
 - With DNSSEC enabled, the authoritative server for the zone creates a "package" of resource records (called an RRset) signed with a private key (the Zone Signing Key). 
 - When another server requests a secure record exchange, the authoritative server returns the package along with its public key, which can be used to verify the signature.

### Secure Directory Services
 -  A directory facilitates authentication and authorization, and it is critical that it be maintained as a highly secure service.
 -  Most directory services are based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), running over port 389. 
 
### Time Synchronization
 - Many applications on networks are time dependent and time critical. 
 - The Network Time Protocol (NTP) provides a transport over which to synchronize these time dependent applications. NTP works over UDP on port 123.

### SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL SECURITY
 - The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used framework for management and monitoring. 
 - SNMP consists of an SNMP monitor and agents.
   - The agent is a process (software or firmware) running on a switch, router, server, or other SNMP-compatible network device.
   - The SNMP monitor (a software program) provides a location from which network activity can be overseen.

# Secure Network Operations Protocols
1.What vulnerabilities does a rogue DHCP server expose users to?
 > Denial of service (providing an invalid address configuration) and spoofing (providing a malicious address configuration—one that points to a malicious DNS, for instance).

2.Why is it vital to ensure the security of an organization's DNS service?
 > DNS resolves domain names. If it were to be corrupted, users could be directed to spoofed websites. Disrupting DNS can also perform denial of service.

3.True or false? The contents of the HOSTS file are irrelevant as long as a DNS service is properly configured.
 > False (probably)—the contents of the HOSTS file are written to the DNS cache on startup. It is possible to edit the registry to prioritize DNS over HOSTS, though.

4.What is DNS server cache poisoning?
 > Corrupting the records of a DNS server to point traffic destined for a legitimate domain to a malicious IP address.

5.True or false? DNSSEC depends on a chain of trust from the root servers down.
 > True.

6.What are the advantages of SASL over LDAPS?
 > The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) allows a choice of authentication providers and encryption (sealing)/integrity (signing) mechanisms. By contrast, LDAPS uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt traffic, but users still authenticate via simple binding. Also, SASL is the standards-based means of configuring LDAP security.

7.What steps should you take to secure an SNMPv2 service?
 > Configure strong community names and use access control lists to restrict management operations to known hosts.


### Transport Layer Security
 - To implement TLS, a server is assigned a digital certificate signed by some trusted certificate authority (CA). 
 - The certificate proves the identity of the server (assuming that the client trusts the CA) and validates the server's public/private key pair. 
 - The server uses its key pair and the TLS protocol to agree mutually supported ciphers with the client and negotiate an encrypted communications session.

#### FTPS negotiates a SSL/TLS tunnel before excahnge of any FTP commands and uses port 990 for control connection.
