### Network Address Allocation (DHCP)

 - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides an automatic method for network address allocation. 
 - The key point about DHCP is that only one server should be offering addresses to any one group of hosts. 
 - If a rogue DHCP server is set up, it can perform DoS (as client machines will obtain an incorrect TCP/IP configuration) or be used to snoop network information. 
 - DHCP starvation is a type of DoS attack where a rogue client repeatedly requests new IP addresses using spoofed MAC addresses, with the aim of exhausting the IP address pool.

### DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)
 - help to mitigate against spoofing and poisoning attacks by providing a validation process for DNS responses. 
 - With DNSSEC enabled, the authoritative server for the zone creates a "package" of resource records (called an RRset) signed with a private key (the Zone Signing Key). 
 - When another server requests a secure record exchange, the authoritative server returns the package along with its public key, which can be used to verify the signature.
