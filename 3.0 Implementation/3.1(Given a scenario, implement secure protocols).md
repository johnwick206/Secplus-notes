### Network Address Allocation (DHCP)

 - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides an automatic method for network address allocation. 
 - The key point about DHCP is that only one server should be offering addresses to any one group of hosts. 
 - If a rogue DHCP server is set up, it can perform DoS (as client machines will obtain an incorrect TCP/IP configuration) or be used to snoop network information. 
 - DHCP starvation is a type of DoS attack where a rogue client repeatedly requests new IP addresses using spoofed MAC addresses, with the aim of exhausting the IP address pool.
