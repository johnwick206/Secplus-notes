## SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

 - A SIEM parses network traffic and log data from multiple sensors, appliances, and hosts and normalizes the information to standard field types.Â 

### Correlation

 - The SIEM can then run correlation rules on indicators extracted from the data sources to detect events that should be investigated as potential incidents. You can also filter or query the data based on the type of incident that has been reported.
 - Correlation means interpreting the relationship between individual data points to diagnose incidents of significance to the security team. 
 - A SIEM correlation rule is a statement that matches certain conditions. 
 - These rules use logical expressions, such as AND and OR, and operators, such as == (matches), < (less than), > (greater than), and in (contains). 

### Sensors  
 - A sensor is a network tap or port mirror that performs packet capture and intrusion detection. 
 - One of the key uses of a SIEM is to aggregate data from multiple sensors and log sources, but it might also be appropriate to configure dashboards that show output from a single sensor or source host.
