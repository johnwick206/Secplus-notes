## Communication Plan

 - Secure communication between the trusted parties of the CIRT is essential for managing incidents successfully. 
 - It is imperative that adversaries not be alerted to detection and remediation measures about to be taken against them. 
 - It may not be appropriate for all members of the CSIRT to be informed about all incident details.

## Stakeholder Management

 - Trusted parties might include both internal and external stakeholders. 
 - Ensure that parties with privileged information do not release this information to untrusted parties, whether intentionally or inadvertently.

## Incident Response Exercises

 - Tabletop - The facilitator presents a scenario and the responders explain what action they would take to identify, contain, and eradicate the threat. The training does not use computer systems. The scenario data is presented as flashcards.
 - Walkthroughs - in this model, a facilitator presents the scenario as for a tabletop exercise, but the incident responders demonstrate what actions they would take in response. Unlike a tabletop exercise, the responders perform actions such as running scans and analyzing sample files, typically on sandboxed versions of the company's actual response and recovery tools.
 - Simulations - a simulation is a team-based exercise, where the red team attempts an intrusion, the blue team operates response and recovery controls, and a white team moderates and evaluates the exercise. This type of training requires considerable investment and planning.

### Disaster Recovery Plan 
 - a disaster can be seen as a special class of incident where the organization's primary business function is disrupted. 
 - Disaster recovery requires considerable resources, such as shifting processing to a secondary site. 
 - Disaster recovery will involve a wider range of stakeholders than less serious incidents.

### Buisness Continuity Plan
 - this identifies how business processes should deal with both minor and disaster-level disruption. 
 - During an incident, a system may need to be isolated. 
 - Continuity planning ensures that there is processing redundancy supporting the workflow, so that when a server is taken offline for security remediation, processing can failover to a separate system. 
 - If systems do not have this sort of planned resilience, incident response will be much more disruptive.

### Continuity of Operation Planning (COOP)
 - this terminology is used for government facilities, but is functionally similar to business continuity planning. 
 - In some definitions, COOP refers specifically to backup methods of performing mission functions without IT support.

#### Retention Policy - Dictates for how long information needs to be kept available on backup and archive systems. This may be subject to legislative requirements.

# Incident Response Procedures

1.What are the six phases of the incident response life cycle?
 > Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

2.True or false? It is important to publish all security alerts to all members of staff.
 > Falseâ€”security alerts should be sent to those able to deal with them at a given level of security awareness and on a need-to-know basis.

3.You are providing security consultancy to assist a company with improving incident response procedures. The business manager wants to know why an out-of-band contact mechanism for responders is necessary. What do you say?
 > he response team needs a secure channel to communicate over without alerting the threat actor. There may also be availability issues with the main communication network, if it has been affected by the incident.

4.Which attack framework provides descriptions of specific TTPs?
 > MITRE's ATT&CK framework.

5.Your consultancy includes a training segment. What type of incident response exercise will best represent a practical incident handling scenario?
 > A simulation exercise creates an actual intrusion scenario, with a red team performing the intrusion and a blue team attempting to identify, contain, and eradicate it.
