## Communication Plan

 - Secure communication between the trusted parties of the CIRT is essential for managing incidents successfully. 
 - It is imperative that adversaries not be alerted to detection and remediation measures about to be taken against them. 
 - It may not be appropriate for all members of the CSIRT to be informed about all incident details.

## Stakeholder Management

 - Trusted parties might include both internal and external stakeholders. 
 - Ensure that parties with privileged information do not release this information to untrusted parties, whether intentionally or inadvertently.

## Incident Response Exercises

 - Tabletop - The facilitator presents a scenario and the responders explain what action they would take to identify, contain, and eradicate the threat. The training does not use computer systems. The scenario data is presented as flashcards.
 - Walkthroughs - in this model, a facilitator presents the scenario as for a tabletop exercise, but the incident responders demonstrate what actions they would take in response. Unlike a tabletop exercise, the responders perform actions such as running scans and analyzing sample files, typically on sandboxed versions of the company's actual response and recovery tools.
 - Simulations - a simulation is a team-based exercise, where the red team attempts an intrusion, the blue team operates response and recovery controls, and a white team moderates and evaluates the exercise. This type of training requires considerable investment and planning.
