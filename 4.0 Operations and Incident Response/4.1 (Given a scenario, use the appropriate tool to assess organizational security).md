### The following tools can be used to test the routing configuration and connectivity with remote hosts and networks.

 - route (Linux)
 - tracert (Windows)
 - traceroute (Linux)
 - pathping (Windows)

### Service Discovery with Nmap

 - TCP SYN (-sS)
 - UDP scans (-sU)
 - Port Range (-p)

## Packet Capture and tcpdump

 - Packet analysis refers to deep-down frame-by-frame scrutiny of captured frames.
 - Protocol analysis means using statistical tools to analyze a sequence of packets, or packet trace.
 - tcpdump is a command line packet capture utility for Linux.

# Organizational Security with Network Reconnaissance Tools

1.You suspect that a rogue host is acting as the default gateway for a subnet in a spoofing attack. What command line tool(s) can you use from a Windows client PC in the same subnet to check the interface properties of the default gateway?
 > Use ipconfig to check the IP addresses of the default gateway and the DHCP server. Use arp to check the MAC addresses associated with those IP addresses and investigate possible spoofing. You could also use the route command to verify the properties of the default route.

2.You suspect the rogue host is modifying traffic before forwarding it, with the side effect of increasing network latency. Which tool could you use to measure latency on traffic routed from this subnet?
 > From a Windows host, the pathping tool can be used to measure latency along a route.

3.What type of tool could you use to fingerprint the host acting as the default gateway?
 > This requires a tool that performs fingerprinting—service and version detection—by examining responses to network probes and comparing them to known responses from common platforms. Nmap is very widely used for this task, or you could use hping or Netcat.

4.You are investigating a Linux server that is the source of suspicious network traffic. At a terminal on the server, which tool could you use to check which process is using a given TCP port?
 > You can use the netstat command to do this.

5.What is a zone transfer and which reconnaissance tools can be used to test whether a server will allow one?
 > A zone transfer is where a domain name server (DNS) allows a client to request all the name records for a domain. nslookup (Windows) and dig (principally Linux) can be used to test whether this query is allowed. You could also mention the dnsenum tool, which will check for zone transfers along with other enumeration tests on DNS infrastructure.

6.What type of organizational security assessment is performed using Nessus?
 > Nessus is an automated network vulnerability scanner that checks for software vulnerabilities and missing patches.

7.You are developing new detection rules for a network security scanner. Which tool will be of use in testing whether the rules match a malicious traffic sample successfully?
 > The tcpreplay tool can be used to stream captured traffic from a file to a monitored network interface.

8.What security posture assessment could a pen tester make using Netcat?
 > Whether it is possible to open a network connection to a remote host over a given port.

## Cuckoo

 - Cuckoo is packaged software that aims to provide a turnkey sandbox solution
 - A sandbox is a system configured to be completely isolated from its host so that the malware cannot "break out." 
 - The sandbox will be designed to record file system and registry changes plus network activity.
