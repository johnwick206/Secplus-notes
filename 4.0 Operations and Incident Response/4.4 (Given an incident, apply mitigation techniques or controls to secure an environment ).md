## Incident Eradication and Recovery

**Eradication of malware or other intrusion mechanisms and recovery from the attack will involve several steps:**
 - Reconstitution of affected systems—either remove the malicious files or tools from affected systems or restore the systems from secure backups/images.
 - Reaudit security controls—ensure they are not vulnerable to another attack. This could be the same attack or from some new attack that the attacker could launch through information they have gained about your network.
 - Ensure that affected parties are notified and provided with the means to remediate their own systems. 

## Quarantine

 - If mitigating techniques are not successful, or the results are uncertain, the endpoint will require careful management before being integrated back onto the network. 
 - If further evidence needs to be gathered, the best approach may be to quarantine or sandbox the endpoint or suspect process/file. 
 - This allows for analysis of the attack or tool and collection of evidence using digital forensic techniques.
