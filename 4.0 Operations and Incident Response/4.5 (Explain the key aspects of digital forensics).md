# Digital Forensics Documentation

What is the significance of the fact that digital evidence is latent?
 > The evidence cannot be seen directly but must be interpreted so the validity of the interpreting process must be unquestionable.

2.What should be the first action at a crime scene during a forensic investigation?
 > Preserve the crime scene by recording everything as is, preferably on video.

3.Why might a file time stamp not show the time at which a crime was committed?
 > The time stamp may record the Universal Coordinated Time rather than the local time. An offset would need to be applied (and it might need to be demonstrated that the computer's time zone was correctly set).

4.You've fulfilled your role in the forensic process and now you plan on handing the evidence over to an analysis team. What important process should you observe during this transition, and why?
 > It's important to uphold a record of how evidence is handled in a chain of custody. The chain of custody will help verify that everyone who handled the evidence is accounted for, including when the evidence was in each person's custody. This is an important tool in validating the evidence's integrity.

## System Memory Acquisition
 
 - System memory is volatile data held in Random Access Memory (RAM) modules. Volatile means that the data is lost when power is removed. 
 - A system memory dump creates an image file that can be analyzed to identify the processes that are running, the contents of temporary file systems, registry data, network connections, cryptographic keys, and more. 
 - It can also be a means of accessing data that is encrypted when stored on a mass storage device. 

# Digital Forensics Evidence Acquisition

1.You must recover the contents of the ARP cache as vital evidence of a man-in-the-middle attack. Should you shut down the PC and image the hard drive to preserve it?
 > No, the ARP cache is stored in memory and will be discarded when the computer is powered off. You can either dump the system memory or run the arp utility and make a screenshot. In either case, make sure that you record the process and explain your actions.

2.Which command line tool allows image creation from disk media on any Linux host?
 > The dd tool is installed on all Linux distributions.

3.True or false? To ensure evidence integrity, you must make a hash of the media before making an image.
 > True.

4.What type of forensic data is recovered using a carving tool?
 > A carving tool allows close inspection of an image to locate artifacts. Artifacts are data objects and structures that are not obvious from examination by ordinary file browsing tools, such as alternate data streams, cache entries, and deleted file remnants.
