# Digital Forensics Documentation

What is the significance of the fact that digital evidence is latent?
 > The evidence cannot be seen directly but must be interpreted so the validity of the interpreting process must be unquestionable.

2.What should be the first action at a crime scene during a forensic investigation?
 > Preserve the crime scene by recording everything as is, preferably on video.

3.Why might a file time stamp not show the time at which a crime was committed?
 > The time stamp may record the Universal Coordinated Time rather than the local time. An offset would need to be applied (and it might need to be demonstrated that the computer's time zone was correctly set).

4.You've fulfilled your role in the forensic process and now you plan on handing the evidence over to an analysis team. What important process should you observe during this transition, and why?
 > It's important to uphold a record of how evidence is handled in a chain of custody. The chain of custody will help verify that everyone who handled the evidence is accounted for, including when the evidence was in each person's custody. This is an important tool in validating the evidence's integrity.
