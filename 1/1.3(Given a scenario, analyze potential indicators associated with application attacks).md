Notes:
 - If the memory location is invalid or null (perhaps by some malicious process altering the execution environment), this creates a null pointer dereference type of exception, and the process will crash, probably. In some circumstances, this might also allow a threat actor to run arbitrary code. 
 - A race condition is one means of engineering a null pointer dereference exception. Race conditions occur when the outcome from an execution process is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events, and those events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer. (DirtyCOW)
 - A time of check to time of use (TOCTTOU) race condition occurs when there is a change between when an app checked a resource and when the app used the resource. This change invalidates the check.  
 - Refactoring means that the code performs the same function by using different methods (control blocks, variable types, and so on). Refactoring means that the A-V software may no longer identify the malware by its signature.
